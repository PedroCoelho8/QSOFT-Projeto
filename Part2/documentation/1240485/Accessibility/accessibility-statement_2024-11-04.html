<ol class="technical-information accessibility-limitations">
	<li><strong>Insufficient Contrast Ratio</strong>: The background and foreground colors in some parts of the application do not have a sufficient contrast ratio, which may make it difficult for people with visual impairments to distinguish between different elements. This issue arises because the JHipster application defines these colors by default, and they may not meet the WCAG 2.1 standards for contrast. because The jhipster application defines it by default. Potential Solution Working on updating the color scheme to ensure better contrast between the background and foreground elements. Other solution was to remove the banner . .</li>
